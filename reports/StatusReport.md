# Status Report (~1500-2000 words)

## Task Updates
An update on each of the tasks described on your project plan including references to specific artifacts in your repository (such as datasets, scripts, workflows, workflow diagrams, etc). → You should include anything you have been working on so far; it doesn't need to be polished, but you should have some code or similar artifacts in the repository, such as datasets, scripts, workflows, workflow diagrams, etc., to support your status updates and demonstrate tangible progress.

note to self: commit crimes dataset (subset - too large right now)

## Timeline	
An updated timeline indicating the status of each task and when they will be completed (talk about next steps)

Original timeline to reference:
Our current plan for the timeline for implementing our project starts with collecting the datasets, setting up the repo, verifying data integrity, and organizing folders during week 1-2, which was completed by Isha. Our future timeline will be:
* **Week 3-4:** Data cleaning, profiling, initial exploration, check inconsistencies → Isha
  * artifacts/code to include: raw datasets, notebook with data loading, cleaning, missing value checks basic profiling, etc, with time maybe add a workflow diagram with a flowchart including the data cleaning steps??
* **Week 5-6:** Integration (by location & year, handle mismatched schemas) → Isha
  * artifacts/code to include: Integrated dataset (save cleaned and then integrated dataset), notebook with mapping and joining schema
* **Week 7-8:** Former analysis, first visualizations (scatter plots, bar charts, maps) → Amritha
  * artifacts/code to include: notebook with anaylsis and visualization including summary statistics, bar charts, scatter plots, correlation tables, notes about trends in markdown, etc
* **Week 8-9:** Automate workflow (python scripts), test reproducibility → Isha
  * artifacts/code to include: add python scripts (.py) underneath script folder
* **Week 9-10:** final touches, polish write ups/docs, checking for reproducibility → both
* **Week 11-12:** Submit (Github release, status report updates, and final README) → both

## Changes
A description of any changes to your project plan itself, in particular about your progress so far. Also include changes you made to your plan based on feedback you may have received for Milestone 2.

~feedback --> fix licensing explanation part for dataset explaination

## Contributions
Each team member has to write a short summary of their contributions to the current milestone. Each team member should add and commit their contribution summary themselves to the shared github repo.
